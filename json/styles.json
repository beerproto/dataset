In general, beers with high hopping rates, roast malt, high alcohol content, and/or complex herbal, smoke or fruit character are the best candidates for aging. Aged Beers may be aged in bottles, cans, kegs or other non-wooden vessels. Aged character may be expressed in mouthfeel, aroma and ﬂavor. Often, aged character is the result of oxidative reactions that either bring individual flavor components into harmony or are unique flavors unto themselves. Sherry-like and fruity flavors often develop during aging, and hop character often changes. No matter what the effect, the overall character should be balanced and without aggressive flavors. The level of change created by aging will vary with the duration of aging and the underlying beer style. Mildly-ﬂavored beers are more likely to develop aggressive and unpleasant oxidation. Positive transformations are more likely to occur in beers with higher levels of hops, malt and/or alcohol.Within the framework of these guidelines, Wood-Aged Beers, Brett Beers, Sour Beers or beers exhibiting attributes of aging in the presence of any microflora must be categorized elsewhere.
