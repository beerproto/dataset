However, we offer you RICE MALT. During the malting process, several substances break down, such as proteins, beta glucans and polysaccharides, as well as the production and release of enzymes that will break these substances evenly during mashing. For this reason, RICE MALT has a lower gelatinization temperature and has enzymes that will assist in the production of a must suitable for the growth of yeast and the production of your beer, which can be called gluten-free beer.",
