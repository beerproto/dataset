The curing time and temperature are not extreme, which allows the enzymes to support  the use of special non-enzymatic malts such as caramel or roasted."

For the maintenance of a light color and with a high level of enzymes, pilsen malt does not force its modification and must be taken care during drying so that the curing temperature is sufficient for elimination of DMS precursors and inactivation of oxidative enzymes and development of flavor without, however, compromising the proteolytic and amylolytic enzymes needed in brazing."

The curing temperature, different from the other caramels, is not very high which causes a very mild caramelization, but a strong sweet flavor. Due to the fact that it is subjected to high humidity temperatures, the enzymatic loss is considerable and, therefore, it must be used in mixture with base malts."

,Atelier Do Malte,White Rice Malt TERROIR PAULISTA,specialty,7,62,5,0.2,,,10,1.6,125,80,Brazil,,46,,,"WHITE RICE MALT is a novelty from Atelier Do Malte. We have been developing malt options to supply microbrewers and home-made adventurers with new options of GLUTEN-FREE MALT and different NATIONAL products for those with creativity and looking for novelties. A disadvantage of working with uncooked rice as an adjunct to beer is its high gelatinization temperature, making it difficult to break down starch in sugars, generating a low extract, and also the lack of enzymes to guarantee the breakdown of numerous substances in rice and needing a separate decoction process. However, we offer you RICE MALT. During the malting process, several substances break down, such as proteins, beta glucans and polysaccharides, as well as the production and release of enzymes that will break these substances evenly during mashing. For this reason, RICE MALT has a lower gelatinization temperature and has enzymes that will assist in the production of a must suitable for the growth of yeast and the production of your beer, which can be called gluten-free beer."

For the development of color, Munich wheat malt forces its modification (higher moisture in the maceration and germination time). At the beginning of drying, it is stewed to produce free amino acids that will facilitate the browning reactions.
