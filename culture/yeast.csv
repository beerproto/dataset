The final master blend consists of Saison yeast, wild Saccharomyces, rare Brettanomyces and an opportunistic Lactobacillus culture. At temperatures as low as 68F (20C) The Mad Fermentationist Saison Blend exhibits a relatively clean primary fermentation profile and high attenuation. Traditional saison temperatures (around 80F/27C) bring out citrus and elevated phenols (pepper and clove). The Brett character shifts depending on wort composition, as maltier beers emphasize cherry and stone fruit qualities. This blend integrates beautifully with fruity and tropical hops, with the unique Brett culture keeping hop aromatics crisp and bright for an extended time. For best results use a highly fermentable wort, dry hopping during the tail of active fermentation, and carbonating naturally."

The progeny of Irish Ale (OYL-005) and French Saison (OYL-026), this true genetic hybrid is a beast at devouring sugars, which creates a very dry beer without any of the peppery, clove phenolics associated with saisons and Belgian ales. Expect a citrus-forward aroma with hints of peach and a clean finish. Gulo Ale excels in any style where a high level of attenuation is desired without phenolics.

Wyeast,Rocky Mountain Lager,WY2105,,Liquid,,,,,,,9,70,74,57.1429,9,13,"Lager, German Pils","A lager yeast said to be born high in the Colorado Rockies, this strain ferments well at cooler temperatures and is perfect for all North American Lagers, light pilsners, and adjunct beers. 2105-PC will create well-balanced beers with a mild malty profile, medium esters, and an emphasis on the malt finish."
Wyeast,Roeselare Ale Blend,WY3763,Hybrid,Liquid,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, & Pediococcus",,,,,,11,80,,,18,29,"Lambic, Flanders Red Ale","Our blend of lambic cultures produce beer with a complex, earthy profile and a distinctive pie cherry sourness. Aging up to 18 months is required for a full flavor profile and acidity to develop. Specific proportions of a Belgian style ale strain, a sherry strain, two Brettanomyces strains, a Lactobacillus culture, and a Pediococcus culture produce the desirable flavor components of these beers as they are brewed in West Flanders. Propagation of this culture is not recommended and will result in a change of the proportions of the individual components. This blend will produce a very dry beer due to the super-attenuative nature of the mixed cultures."
Wyeast,Saison-Brett Blend,WY3031,Mixed-culture,Liquid,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. diastaticus, Brettanomyces",,,,,,12,80,90,14.2857,18,27,"Saison, Brett, Sour Ale, Belgian Strong Ale",A blend of two saison strains and Brettanomyces creates a dry and complex ale.

Thames Valley II produces crisp, dry beers with a rich malt profile and moderate stone fruit esters. This attenuative strain is also highly flocculent resulting in bright beers not requiring filtration. A thorough diacetyl rest is recommended after fermentation is complete."
Wyeast,Weihenstephan Weizen,WY3068,,Liquid,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,,,,,,10,73,77,14.2857,18,24,"Hefeweizen, Wheats, Weissbier, Fruit Beers","The classic and most popular German wheat beer strain used worldwide. This yeast strain produces a beautiful and delicate balance of banana esters and clove phenolics. The balance can be manipulated towards ester production through increasing the fermentation temperature, increasing the wort density, and decreasing the pitch rate. Over pitching can result in a near complete loss of banana character. Decreasing the ester level will allow a higher clove character to be perceived. Sulfur is commonly produced, but will dissipate with conditioning. This strain is very powdery and will remain in suspension for an extended amount of time following attenuation. This is true top cropping yeast and requires fermentor headspace of 33%."
Wyeast,West Coast IPA,WY1217,,Liquid,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,,,,,,10,73,80,57.1429,17,23,"Pale Ales, Brown Ales, IPA, Scottish Light, Double IPA","This strain is ideally suited to the production of West Coast-style American craft beers, especially pale, IPA, red, and specialties. Thorough attenuation, temperature tolerance, and good flocculation make this an easy strain to work with. Flavor is balanced neutral with mild ester formation at warmer temperatures, allowing hops, character malts, and flavorings to show through."
Wyeast,West Yorkshire Ale,WY1469,,Liquid,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,,,,,,9,67,71,71.4286,18,22,"English IPA, Stout, Bitters","This strain produces ales with a full chewy malt flavor and character, but finishes dry, producing famously balanced beers.
