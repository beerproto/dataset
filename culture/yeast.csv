If soured before kettle boil, boil with hop additions as usual. If soured after kettle boil cool wort and pitch yeast. II) “Co-Pitch”: Pitch GB110 into a primary with yeast of your choice at 68-72 F. Wort that is less than 1050 and 7 IBU will typically be very sour in 2-3 weeks. III) “Secondary”: Pitch GB110 after primary fermentation for an aged sour.

Sourvisiae contains a single genetic modification, a lactate dehydrogenase gene from a food microorganism, which enables the yeast to produce high levels of lactic acid, the main compound that gives sour beers their flavor. Sourvisiae allows the brewer to ferment and sour the beer in one simple step, reducing cross-contamination risks, lowering costs, cutting total process time, and allowing brewers to obtain a consistent product. The brewing process is conducted without any modifications; Sourvisiae is pitched just like conventional yeast and ferments in a normal fermentation time. Sourvisiae does not produce other flavor compounds associated with Brettanomyces, Lachancea, or Lactic Acid Bacteria, providing a cleaner and more reproducible souring process, with much shorter fermentation times."
